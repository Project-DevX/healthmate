🔥 FIREBASE INDEX CREATION STEPS:

1. ✅ You should see a form titled "Create Index"
2. ✅ Collection ID should be: consent_requests
3. ✅ Fields should be configured as:
   - patientId (Ascending)
   - status (Ascending)  
   - requestDate (Descending)
   - __name__ (Descending)

4. 🚀 Click "Create Index" button
5. ⏱️ Wait 2-5 minutes for index to build
6. ✅ Status will change from "Building" to "Ready"

🎯 AFTER INDEX CREATION:
- Go back to your Flutter app
- Hot restart the app (press R in terminal)
- Look for: "✅ CONSENT NOTIFICATIONS: Successfully loaded notifications"
- Notification badge should show accurate count

🔔 EXPECTED RESULT:
Instead of the error, you should see:
✅ CONSENT NOTIFICATIONS: Connection state: ConnectionState.active
✅ CONSENT NOTIFICATIONS: Has data: true  
✅ CONSENT NOTIFICATIONS: Found 1 pending requests
✅ CONSENT NOTIFICATIONS: Query successful - no more index errors!
