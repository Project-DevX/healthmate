# Dynamic Lab Report Classification System

## Overview

This document outlines a proposed enhancement to the current lab report classification system, moving from a predefined category-based approach to a fully dynamic, AI-driven classification system that learns and adapts based on Gemini's analysis of actual lab report content.

## Current System Analysis

### How It Currently Works

1. **Predefined Categories**: The system uses a hardcoded list of 19 lab report types:
   ```javascript
   [
     'blood_sugar',
     'cholesterol_lipid_panel', 
     'liver_function_tests',
     'kidney_function_tests',
     'thyroid_function_tests',
     'complete_blood_count',
     'cardiac_markers',
     'vitamin_levels',
     'inflammatory_markers',
     'hormone_tests',
     'diabetes_markers',
     'iron_studies',
     'bone_markers',
     'cancer_markers',
     'infectious_disease_tests',
     'autoimmune_markers',
     'coagulation_studies',
     'electrolyte_panel',
     'protein_studies'
   ]
   ```

2. **Classification Process**:
   - Document is classified as "lab_reports" category
   - AI attempts to match content to one of the predefined types
   - If no match found, defaults to "other_lab_tests"
   - Uses explicit mappings like "CBC → complete_blood_count"

3. **Limitations**:
   - **Rigid Structure**: Cannot accommodate new/emerging lab test types
   - **Forcing Fit**: AI must force lab reports into predefined categories
   - **Limited Scope**: Many specialized tests fall into "other_lab_tests"
   - **Manual Maintenance**: Adding new types requires code updates

## Proposed Dynamic System

### Core Concept

Replace the predefined category system with a **dynamic, AI-driven classification** that:

1. **Learns from Content**: Gemini analyzes each lab report and determines its natural classification
2. **Creates Categories**: New lab report types are automatically created based on AI analysis
3. **Tracks Evolution**: System maintains a growing database of discovered lab report types
4. **User-Specific Learning**: Each user builds their own personalized lab report taxonomy

### Key Benefits

#### 1. **Unlimited Flexibility**
- No predefined constraints on lab report types
- Accommodates any medical test or specialized panel
- Adapts to new medical technologies and test types
- Handles regional variations in test naming

#### 2. **Natural Language Classification**
- Uses descriptive names like "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel" instead of "electrolyte_panel"
- Maintains medical terminology as used in actual reports
- Preserves brand names and specific test variations

#### 3. **Intelligent Grouping with Historical Context**
- AI considers patient's existing lab report types before creating new ones
- Prevents unnecessary category proliferation by matching to existing types
- Groups related tests (e.g., "Lipid Panel", "Extended Lipid Profile", "Cholesterol Screening")
- Creates hierarchical classifications when appropriate
- **Consistency Priority**: Always tries to match existing types before creating new ones

#### 4. **Personalized Experience**
- Each user's lab report library reflects their actual medical history
- Common patterns emerge naturally for frequent patients
- Specialist patients (e.g., diabetics, cardiac patients) develop relevant taxonomies
- **Learning from History**: System becomes more accurate as it learns patient patterns

## Historical Context Integration

### The Problem with Unlimited Classification
Without constraints, AI might create too many similar categories:
- "Complete Blood Count"
- "CBC with Differential" 
- "Full Blood Count"
- "Blood Count Panel"

All referring to essentially the same test type, leading to fragmented organization.

### Solution: AI-Powered Historical Matching

#### Priority-Based Classification Logic
1. **First Priority**: Match existing user types exactly
2. **Second Priority**: Recognize variations of existing types  
3. **Third Priority**: Identify similar types and suggest merging
4. **Last Resort**: Create new type only if genuinely different

#### Historical Context Prompt Enhancement
The AI receives:
- **User's existing lab types** with frequency counts
- **Sample tests** from each existing category
- **Recent examples** of each type
- **Usage patterns** (weekly, monthly, annually)

#### Smart Matching Examples
```
Existing Type: "Complete Blood Count" (seen 8 times)
New Report: "CBC with Auto Differential"
AI Decision: Match to existing "Complete Blood Count" ✓

Existing Type: "Lipid Panel" (seen 4 times) 
New Report: "Comprehensive Cholesterol Test"
AI Decision: Match to existing "Lipid Panel" ✓

No Similar Existing Types
New Report: "Vitamin B12 and Folate"
AI Decision: Create new type "Vitamin B12 and Folate" ✓
```

#### Benefits of Historical Context
1. **Prevents Category Explosion**: Maintains clean, organized taxonomy
2. **Improves Consistency**: Same test types grouped together over time
3. **Learns User Patterns**: Understands how specific labs name their tests
4. **Reduces Maintenance**: Less need for manual merging and cleanup
5. **Better Search Results**: Related tests stay together for easier finding

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: AI-Driven Natural Classification

#### Enhanced Gemini Prompt with Historical Context
Instead of forcing selection from predefined types, provide AI with user's historical context:

```
Analyze this lab report and classify it appropriately.

PATIENT'S EXISTING LAB REPORT TYPES:
${userLabTypes.map(type => `- ${type.name} (seen ${type.frequency} times)`).join('\n')}

CLASSIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **First Priority**: If this lab report matches or is very similar to any existing type above, use that existing type name exactly
2. **Second Priority**: If this is clearly a variation of an existing type, use the existing name (e.g., "CBC with Auto Diff" should match "Complete Blood Count")
3. **Last Resort**: Only create a new type if this lab report is genuinely different from all existing types

When analyzing, consider:
- Primary tests performed
- Medical panel or category  
- Clinical purpose/focus area
- Similarity to existing patient types

If creating a NEW type, provide a name that:
- Uses standard medical terminology
- Is specific enough to be meaningful
- Is general enough to group similar future reports
- Follows medical naming conventions

RESPONSE FORMAT:
{
  "classification": "exact name from existing types OR new type name",
  "isExistingType": true/false,
  "reasoning": "explanation of why this classification was chosen",
  "similarToExisting": "name of similar existing type if applicable",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}

Examples of good NEW classifications (only if no existing match):
- "Complete Blood Count with Differential"
- "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel"
- "Thyroid Function Panel"
- "Cardiac Enzyme Panel"
- "Lipid Profile"
- "Liver Function Tests"
- "Hemoglobin A1c"
- "Vitamin D Level"
```

#### Storage Structure
```
/users/{userId}/lab_classifications/
├── discovered_types/           # All discovered lab types for this user
│   ├── {typeId}/
│   │   ├── name: "Complete Blood Count with Differential"
│   │   ├── firstSeen: timestamp
│   │   ├── frequency: number of times seen
│   │   ├── relatedTypes: [array of similar types]
│   │   ├── sampleTests: [typical tests in this category]
│   │   └── examples: [document references]
│   └── ...
├── classification_history/     # Track classification evolution
└── user_preferences/          # User customizations
```

### Phase 2: Intelligent Type Management

#### Similarity Detection
- AI identifies when new reports are similar to existing types
- Suggests merging or creating relationships
- Handles variations like "CBC" vs "Complete Blood Count"

#### Auto-Grouping Algorithm with Historical Context
```javascript
async function classifyLabReport(labContent, userId) {
  // Get user's existing lab report types with usage frequency
  const userLabTypes = await getUserLabTypesWithStats(userId);
  
  // Get AI's classification with historical context
  const aiClassification = await getAIClassificationWithHistory(labContent, userLabTypes);
  
  if (aiClassification.isExistingType) {
    // Use existing type and increment frequency
    return await updateExistingLabType(aiClassification.classification, userId);
  } else {
    // Check if AI wants to create new type - validate it's truly different
    const similarity = await validateNewTypeNecessity(aiClassification, userLabTypes);
    
    if (similarity.shouldMerge) {
      // Suggest merge with existing similar type
      return await suggestMergeWithExisting(aiClassification, similarity.targetType, userId);
    } else {
      // Create genuinely new type
      return await createNewLabType(aiClassification, userId);
    }
  }
}

async function getUserLabTypesWithStats(userId) {
  // Return user's lab types with frequency and examples
  return userLabTypes.map(type => ({
    name: type.displayName,
    frequency: type.frequency,
    lastSeen: type.lastSeen,
    sampleTests: type.sampleTests,
    examples: type.examples.slice(0, 2) // Recent examples
  }));
}
```

#### Smart Suggestions with Context Awareness
- **Historical Matching**: "This matches your existing 'Lipid Panel' type from 3 previous reports"
- **Variation Detection**: "This looks like a variation of 'Complete Blood Count' - should we group them?"
- **Frequency Insights**: "You have 5 types of blood tests - want to organize them?"
- **Merge Suggestions**: "CBC and 'Complete Blood Count with Differential' seem similar - merge them?"
- **Pattern Recognition**: "You typically get thyroid tests quarterly - this fits that pattern"
- Auto-merge obvious duplicates with user confirmation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

#### Hierarchical Classification
```
Cardiovascular Tests/
├── Cardiac Enzymes
├── Lipid Profiles
├── Coagulation Studies
└── Blood Pressure Monitoring

Endocrine Tests/
├── Thyroid Function
├── Diabetes Monitoring
