# 🏗️ Prescription Pricing Architecture Update

## 📋 **Overview**

This document outlines the major architectural improvement to the prescription workflow that eliminates stale pricing data by removing prices from prescriptions and calculating them dynamically during pharmacy fulfillment.

---

## 🚫 **Previous Architecture Issues**

### **Problem: Stale Pricing Data**
- Doctors included pricing information when creating prescriptions
- Prices were stored in prescription documents at creation time
- If inventory prices changed, prescription documents had outdated pricing
- Bills generated from old prescriptions showed incorrect amounts

### **Example Issue**
```
Doctor creates prescription: Amoxicillin $15.00
↓
Pharmacy updates inventory: Amoxicillin $12.00  
↓
Bill generated from prescription: Still shows $15.00 ❌
```

## ✅ **New Architecture Solution**

### **Core Principle: Dynamic Pricing**
- Prescriptions contain **only medical information** (no pricing)
- Pricing is calculated **dynamically from inventory** during bill generation
- Always uses **current, accurate pricing** from pharmacy inventory

### **Data Flow**
```
Doctor creates prescription
├── Medicine name, dosage, quantity, instructions ✅
├── NO pricing information ✅
└── totalAmount: 0.0

Pharmacy processes prescription (ready → delivered)
├── Fetch current prices from inventory
├── Calculate bill with live pricing
└── Generate accurate bill ✅
```

---

## 🔧 **Implementation Changes**

### **1. Updated PrescriptionMedicine Model**
```dart
class PrescriptionMedicine {
  final String name;
  final String dosage;
  final String frequency;
  final String duration;
  final String instructions;
  final int quantity;  // Added quantity field
  // ❌ Removed: No price field
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Bill Generation**
```dart
Future<PharmacyBill> generateBill(PharmacyPrescription prescription) async {
  // Fetch current prices from inventory for each medicine
  for (final medicine in prescription.medicines) {
    final inventoryPrice = await getCurrentPriceFromInventory(medicine.name);
    // Use live inventory pricing ✅
  }
}
```

### **3. Prescription Creation**
```dart
// Doctor creates prescription
'medicines': [
  {
    'name': 'Amoxicillin 500mg',
    'quantity': 21,
    'dosage': '1 tablet 3x daily',
    'duration': '7 days',
    'instructions': 'Take with food',
    // ❌ No 'price' field
  }
],
'totalAmount': 0.0  // Will be calculated dynamically
```

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **1. Always Accurate Pricing**
- Bills show current inventory prices
- No stale pricing data
- Real-time pricing updates

### **2. Cleaner Architecture**
- Medical information separated from financial data
- Single source of truth for pricing (inventory)
- Reduced data duplication

### **3. Better Workflow**
- Doctors focus on medical prescribing
- Pharmacies handle pricing and billing
- Clear separation of concerns

## 🧪 **Testing Verification**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Console logs: "Medicine price: $0.00" ❌
Bill total: $0.00 ❌
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Console logs: 
💰 BILL: Found Amoxicillin 500mg in inventory - Current price: $15.00
💰 BILL: Amoxicillin 500mg line total: $315.00 (21 × $15.00)
💰 BILL: Calculated totals - Subtotal: $315.00, Tax: $25.20, Total: $340.20 ✅
```

## 🚀 **Impact**

This architectural change ensures that:
- ✅ Bills always show current, accurate pricing
- ✅ Inventory price changes are immediately reflected in new bills
- ✅ No more stale pricing data issues
- ✅ Clear separation between medical and financial data
- ✅ Improved system reliability and accuracy

## 📝 **Files Modified**

1. **`lib/models/shared_models.dart`** - Updated PrescriptionMedicine model
2. **`lib/models/prescription_models.dart`** - Removed price from toMap()
3. **`lib/services/pharmacy_service.dart`** - Enhanced generateBill() with dynamic pricing
4. **Sample data** - Removed pricing from all prescription medicine data

**Result: 🎉 Prescription pricing now uses live inventory data, eliminating stale pricing issues!**
